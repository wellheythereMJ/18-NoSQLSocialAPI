## NoSQLSocialAPI

This project involves building an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. The application uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM to manage data.

Developers can use this API to handle user interactions, thoughts, reactions, and friend lists efficiently. The walkthrough video demonstrating the application's functionality and meeting all acceptance criteria is included below:
